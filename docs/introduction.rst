Getting started
===============

QSketchMetric is a tool designed to interpret parametric DXF files and render them. Parametrizing of a DXF file happens
through **QCAD Professional's** CAD software, which is a commercial software. The parametrized DXF file is then interpreted
by QSketchMetric and rendered according to the provided variables.


Why QSketchMetric?
------------------
QSketchMetric was born out of a genuine need. There was an evident demand for a Python tool capable of generating
**DXF 2D** drawings based on parametric descriptions, rendering them according to provided variables.
This tool enables a seamless workflow during the production process, particularly beneficial for devices
like **plotters**.

Typical Use Cases
   Consider a box's cutting layout: with ``qsketchmetric``, it can be dynamically rendered to adapt
   based on its desired size.
